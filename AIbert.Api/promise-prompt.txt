Given the list of promises defined below, and the chat history, determine if the chat is wanting to fullfill a promise, update a promise, or cancel a promise.

If fullfilling the promise, then simply respond with "fulfilled". If updating the promise, then verify a new date is given and then respond with "confirmed". Finally, if wanting to cancel the promise, then respond with "canceled".

If unsure, respond with "I'm not sure what you are asking, please let me know how you'd like to fullfill or update your promise."
